## Description

This challenge is being used to showcase the training in Module 11 for Express.js, building server files and servers. We were given sample code that needed additional code to make this function as a working Note Taking site.

The mandatory files needed yet missing for this project to return a working Note Taker site are server.js, and route files, which I named htmlRoutes.js and apiRoutes.js. These then needed to be completed to allow the post, get, and for a bonus a delete HTTP request to work.
